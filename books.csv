Metchnikoffâs daring theory of immunityâthat voracious cells he called phagocytes formed the first line of defense against invading bacteriaâwould eventually earn the scientist a Nobel Prize, shared with his archrival, as well as the unofficial m oniker âFather of Natural Immunity.â But first he had to win over skeptics, especially those who called his theory âan oriental fairy tale.â Using previously inaccessible archival materials, author Luba Vikhanski chronicles Metchnikoffâs remarkable life and discoveries in the first moder n biography of this hero of medicine. Metchnikoff was a towering figure in the scientific community of the early twentieth century, a tireless humanitarian who, while working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, also strived to curb the spread of cholera, syphilis, and other deadly diseases. In his later years, he startled the world with controversial theories on longevity, launching a global craze for yogurt, and pioneered research into gut microbes and aging. Though Metchnikoff was largely forgotten for nearly a hundred years, Vikhanski documents a remarkable revival of interest in his ideas on immunity and on the gut flora in the science of the twenty-first century. ...more",In stock ,e4f74c16de34d440

How A fascinating exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mindAll our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us.In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living. ...more",In stock ,38d45839cb1c83c1

T Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of theÂ pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generationâs sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, getÂ into and out of relationships, all with the hopeÂ of finding someone with whom we share a deepÂ connection. This seems standard now, but itâsÂ wildly different from what people did even justÂ decades ago. Single people today have moreÂ romantic options than at any point in humanÂ history. With technology, our abilities to connectÂ with and sort through these options are staggering.Â So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.Â âWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?âÂ âShould I go out with this girl even though sheÂ listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?Â Combos?!â âMy girlfriend just got a message fromÂ some dude named Nathan. Whoâs Nathan? Did heÂ just send her a photo of his penis? Should I checkÂ just to be sure?âÂ But the transformation of our romantic livesÂ canât be explained by technology alone. In a shortÂ period of time, the whole culture of finding loveÂ has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,Â people would find a decent person who lived inÂ their neighborhood. Their families would meetÂ and, after deciding neither party seemed like aÂ murderer, they would get married and soon haveÂ a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,Â people marry later than ever and spend years ofÂ their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, aÂ soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming hisÂ comic insight at modern romance, but for ModernÂ Romance, the book, he decided he needed to takeÂ things to another level. He teamed up with NYUÂ sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massiveÂ research project, including hundreds of interviewsÂ and focus groups conducted everywhere fromÂ Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzedÂ behavioral data and surveys and created their ownÂ online research forum on Reddit, which drewÂ thousands of messages. They enlisted the worldâsÂ leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, HelenÂ Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, SherryÂ Turkle, and Robb Willer.

She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Â Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible patternâand with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.Â An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employeesâhow they approach worker safetyâand soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.Â What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. Â They succeeded by transforming habits.Â In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Â Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warrenâs Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nationâs largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.Â At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Â Habits arenât destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. ...more",In stock ,6bdd909329435e80

Second Officer Herbert Stone, in charge of the midnight watch on the SS Californian sitting idly a few miles north, saw the distress rockets that the Titanic fired. He alerted the captain, Stanley Lord, who was sleeping in the chartroom below, but Lord did not come to the bridge. Eight rockets were fired during the dark hours of the midnight watch, and eight rockets were ignored. The next morning, the Titanic was at the bottom of the sea and more than 1,500 people were dead. When they learned of the extent of the tragedy, Lord and Stone did everything they could to hide their role in the disaster, but pursued by newspapermen, lawyers, and political leaders in America and England, their terrible secret was eventually revealed.

Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,Â£48.19,Three,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism. But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century. ...more",In stock ,5b546a46a86a9d8c

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mindâthe so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions. ...more",In stock ,396385e3de5d18c3
